# get_next_line

This is a beta version of my get_next_line.

This function is dependant on the libft to run.

the run.sh and main.c are used to test the function by producing a test_gnl executable which can be usd for displaying the content of a file.

The function's speed can be modified by edditing the BUFF_SIZE, and L_LEN in the header file. This function is also set to handle a defult of 10 diffrent file buffers. The amount of file buffers can also be eddited in the header file, by changing the value of MAX_FILES.
